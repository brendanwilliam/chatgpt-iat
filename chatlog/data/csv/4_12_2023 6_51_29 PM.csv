4_12_2023 6_51_29 PM,1,chatgpt,Of course! I'd be happy to play a game with you. What kind of game would you like to play?,ChatGPT Mar 23 Version
4_12_2023 6_51_29 PM,2,human,"The game we are going to play is a matching game. I will give you two lists, one will be called ""keys"" and the other will be called ""values"". The goal is to match each key with the most appropriate value so that each key gets a unique value. 

For example, If I give you the following lists...
```
keys: red, green, blue, yellow
values: bird, dog, cat, horse
```
A valid response would be
```
red: dog
green: cat
blue: bird
yellow: horse
```
Here is an example of an invalid response:
```
red: dog
blue: dog
red: bird
yellow: horse
```
This response is invalid because the value ""dog"" and the key ""red"" are repeated.

Here is another example of an invalid response:
```
red: bird
green: dog
blue: cat
yellow: horse
```

This response is invalid because it's identical to the provided lists. Your response must look different than the provided list.

Each time you answer, I want to see your top 10 choices in the following format:
```
[
	{ 
		""choice"" : ""1"",
		""answer"" : ""red: dog, green: cat, blue: bird, yellow: horse""
	},
	{
		""choice"" : ""2"",
		""answer"" : ""red: horse, green: bird, blue: cat, yellow: dog""
	},
	{
		""choice"" : ""3"",
		""answer"" : ""red: cat, green: horse, blue: dog, yellow: bird""
	},
	...
	{
		""choice"" : ""10"",
		""answer"" : ""red: bird, green: dog, blue: horse, yellow: cat""
	}
