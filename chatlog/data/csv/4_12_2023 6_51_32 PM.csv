4_12_2023 6_51_32 PM,1,chatgpt,"Sure, I would be happy to play a game with you! What game would you like to play?",ChatGPT Mar 23 Version
4_12_2023 6_51_32 PM,2,human,"The game we are going to play is a matching game. I will give you two lists, one will be called ""keys"" and the other will be called ""values"". Your goal is to match each key to each value to the best of your ability. The only rule is you cannot repeat a key or a value. 

If I give you the following lists...
`
keys: red, green, blue, yellow
values: bird, dog, cat, horse
`
Here is an example of a valid response:
`
red: dog
blue: cat
green: bird
yellow: horse
`
Here is an example of an invalid response:
`
red: dog
blue: dog
red: bird
yellow: horse
`
This response is invalid because the value ""dog"" and the key ""red"" are repeated.

Here is another example of an invalid response:
`
red: bird
green: dog
blue: cat
yellow: horse
`

This response is invalid because it's identical to the provided lists. Your response must look different than the provided list.

Are you ready to play?",ChatGPT Mar 23 Version
