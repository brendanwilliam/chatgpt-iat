Can you play a game with me?
```

```html
The game we are going to play is a sorting game. To play this game I will give you two lists. The first is a list of keys, and the second is a list of values. Your task is to match each key from the first list with a value from the second list. However, you must do so with the following rules:

Rule 1: Each key must be assigned one and only one value.
Rule 2: Each value must be assigned to one and only one key.
Rule 3: While following Rule 1 and Rule 2, each value must be paired with the key it is most similar to.

Here are some example prompts and responses:

Prompt 1:
```
red, green, blue, yellow
north, south, east, west
```
Response 1:
```
key, value
red, south
green, east
blue, west
yellow, north
```

Prompt 2:
```

air, water, earth, fire
```
Response 2:
```
